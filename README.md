##ExpressAnalysis - Boilermake2017 Project
A MixMax Enhancement tool that analyzes e-mail text. The analysis displays the *expressions* conveyed by the email, including traits, such as anger, joy, confidence, and an indicator of how informal/formal the text is. In addition to this, we have implemented analysis that alerts the user if rhetoric representative of cyber-bullying and harassment is detected.

This application is currently live and can be run without MixMax at: https://obscure-garden-21066.herokuapp.com/.

Our Stack: node.js, Express, Embedded JavaScript (EJS)
APIs Used: IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, Nspell, MixMax
