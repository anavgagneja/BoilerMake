##ExpressAnalysis - Boilermake2017 Project
A MixMax Enhancement tool that analyzes e-mail text. The analysis displays the *expressions* conveyed by the email, which includes traits, such as anger, joy, confidence, and an indicator of how informal/formal the text is. We also implemented a feature that would alert the user if the text is determined as a form of cyberbullying. This app is an easy and intuitive way to understand the tones of the text for potential changes or fixes. API's used: Watson and Nspell.

This application can also be run independently of MixMax at https://obscure-garden-21066.herokuapp.com/.
