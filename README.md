##ExpressAnalysis - Boilermake2017 Project
A MixMax Enhancement tool that analyzes e-mail text. The analysis displays the characteristics conveyed by the email, which includes traits, such as anger, joy, confidence, and an indicator of how informal/formal the text is. This application can also be run independently of MixMax. We also implemented a feature that would alert the user if the text is determined as a form of cyberbullying. This app is an easy and intuitive way to understand the tones of the text for potential changes or fixes.
